Version Manual - Press a button and rename all layers

Version Auto - No long override renamed adjustment layers (i.e. rename an adjustment layer "Color Correction" and name will not be changed")
VERSION Auto HAS ISSUES WHEN GOING IN AND OUT OF PRECOMPS. - Scrapped?

To add
+ Select which layer types you want renamed (i.e. solids, shape layers, etc.)
+ When ae dialog opens dont effect script
+ Going in and out of precomps no longer stops renaming process
+ Autofill when searching
+ Searching verbatim, (full effect name, not indexOf)
+ Video preview


# How to install
Go to your after effects install > Support Files > Scripts > ScriptUI Panels > Put script in that folder.

You can also add to the startup folder for it to automatically run upon ae opening
